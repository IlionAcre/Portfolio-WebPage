Welcome to my **[Portfolio Webpage](https://falcontreras.com)** ‚Äî a space where creativity and functionality meet! This project serves as a showcase of my skills, projects, and professional journey as a **Python developer**. Built with **Flask**, **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**, this responsive and interactive website encapsulates who I am and what I bring to the table.

The website is **dockerized** for seamless deployment and scalability, hosted on **Google Cloud Platform (GCP)**, with static assets managed in **AWS S3**. It features a sleek, futuristic design with glowing elements and animations that make the browsing experience engaging and memorable.
